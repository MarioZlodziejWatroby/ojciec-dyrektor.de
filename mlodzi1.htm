        <font size="1">Skinhead culture emerged by 1969 in Britain out of the 
        styles of white mod and black Jamaican rude boy gangs and as a reaction 
        against hippy values. It was a world of scooter rallies, ska and skinhead 
        reggae, and football matches where there was more action among the spectators 
        than on the field. Some did target South Asians and gays for violence, 
        though apparently not to any greater degree than other kids of the time. 
        <br>
        A second wave of skinheads in the late seventies and early eighties came 
        out of the punk scene, although ska retained its skinhead fans. A second 
        wave of ska mixed ska rhythms with punk organization of the scene and 
        yielded such bands as Madness, Selecter, and The Specials. Street punk 
        bands with a skinhead following were labelled Oi by a music writer Gary 
        Bushell, from a Cockney exclamation abundantly used in the songs of the 
        Cockney Rejects, one of the first and best of the bands. According to 
        the record sleeves, oi was a working class reaction against the art students 
        who had overrun the punk scene. Some of the other oi! bands of the time 
        were The Oppressed, The Business, Sham69, Cock Sparrer, Blitz, Last Resort, 
        Condemned84 and Combat84. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Skins were 
        a part of the punk scene in the US at least by the mid-80s. American skin 
        culture came into its own and developed distinct styles around such New 
        York Hardcore (NYHC) bands as Warzone and Agnostic Front, American Oi! 
        bands like Anti-Heros, Iron Cross, Stormwatch, Templars, Dropkick Murphys, 
        Niblick Henbane, and Patriot, and third wave ska catalyzed by MoonSka 
        records in NYC such as Toasters, Pietasters. The Skoidats and Inspecter7 
        crossed the two. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The association 
        of skins with fascism that shapes how skins are talked about in tabloids 
        and talk shows may be greatly exaggerated but has some historical basis: 
        the British fascist parties recruited aggressively among football hooligans 
        - many of whom were skins - with the help of one of the most popular and 
        charismatic oi bands, Skrewdriver. White nationalist groups, particularly 
        White Aryan Resistance, tried the same in the US, and did have some success 
        in recruiting among North American skinheads, and many of their followers 
        shaved their heads in imitation of skinhead style. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A lot of 
        skinheads fought back against the far right. In the late 80s and early 
        90s, SHARP (Skin Heads Against Racial Prejudice) and then redskin crews 
        such as RASH (Red and Anarchist Skin Heads) formed which fought off the 
        Nazis, and claimed a distinction between 'traditional skinheads' who were 
        non racist (though no less homophobic than other youth), and Nazi 'boneheads'. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The violence 
        among skinhead factions - some political and some just gangs chasing the 
        adrenalin rush - resulted in clubs refusing to book skinhead bands, so 
        the settings where skinhead culture could be enacted became sparse. But 
        the image of the Nazi skinhead has captured the public imagination, and 
        talk shows are especially eager to put them on display. They have not 
        shown as much interest in the anti-racist skins who are very likely the 
        majority of skinheads today. Nothing can be assumed of any skinhead's 
        politics although the patches on his flight might give some big clues. 
        Contrary to common belief, lace colors do not mean anything in most areas. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Forget everything 
        you have ever heard about skinheads. Skins know who we are and recognize 
        each other, but there is not much agreement as to what exactly separates 
        skin from nonskin. For a lot of us, beer and brotherhood, oi and ska, 
        defending the working class, and standing by your mates are a big part 
        of it. Well, you can't automatically assume a taste for large quantities 
        of beer: there is a growing number of straight-edge skins who avoid alcohol, 
        tobacco and drugs. For most of us, racial politics are NOT a part of it, 
        and not all of us think you have to be straight to be skin. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There have 
        been gay skins for as long as there have been skinheads, though an amazing 
        number of Skins like to think that all skinheads are straight and always 
        have been. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gay skinheads 
        in Europe, especially London, have created a lively culture of their own; 
        though they are primarily sadomasochists who took on a skinhead identity 
        as a replacement for the biker and lumberjack styles of the leathermen. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In America, 
        gay skins are few but are very much part of the regular skin scene, and 
        keep their distance from the disco-based, fashion-oriented gay culture. 
        American skins can safely assume a lot about each others' favorite music 
        but nothing about their sexuality while generally speaking the European 
        gay skinheads make assumptions about a guy's sexual tastes if he appears 
        to be a skinhead but none at all about their music. </font></p>
      <p> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <br>
        Pride and patriotism <br>
        A Skinhead's &quot;trademark&quot; is his boots, signifying militancy 
        and uniformity. Some have even referred to Skinheads as an &quot;Army,&quot; 
        defending the nation when authorities and officials fail to do the job. 
        White laces, emblematic of the white race, are usually worn, although 
        sometimes red laces are used, to indicate having engaged in combat against 
        the nation's foes or to show solidarity with those who have shed blood 
        in the cause. Skinhead boots are a source of enormous pride and, even, 
        defiance. They symbolize the patriotic, even cocky, temperament born from 
        &quot;boot parties&quot; against Pakis in Britain back in the Seventies. 
        Particularly, boots give Skinheads a unique sense of unity, as they stand 
        as tough as any soldiers and defend as vigilantly as any militiamen. Boots 
        have displayed such a &quot;menacing&quot; look that aliens have been 
        known to flee back across the border, homosexuals slip back into their 
        closets and Negroes fall back in their place upon sight. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Skinhead 
        boots are usually made in London. They are generally steel-toe and high-top, 
        with ten, fourteen or, even, twenty eyes. There is nothing sedentary or 
        sissified about them or the Skinheads who wear them. Some Skinheads report 
        that they feel as thought they are a &quot;one-man army&quot; when they 
        don their boots and show their pride. And, when they are with their friends, 
        they become a whole Skinhead Army, which adds a dynamic to the social-reform 
        scene which neither subversives nor degenerates feel too comforted by. 
        The kind of &quot;military bearing&quot; attached to boots fits in with 
        youth and working men bent upon defending homes, shops and streets against 
        criminals and invaders. In fact, Skinheads relate that since &quot;feminists,&quot; 
        minorities, homosexuals and aliens have been shoved in, it has reached 
        the point that a policeman takes his own life in the United States every 
        twenty-two minutes. And those who try to do their job are either brought 
        up on charges of &quot;discrimination&quot; or &quot;profiling&quot; or 
        just back off, entirely. Hence, Skinheads see their own presence and activism 
        as vital to the survival of not only their nation, but their blood and 
        people. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOOTS</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Can be anywhere 
        from 8 to 20 hole. Doctor Martens are by far the most popular skinhead 
        boots around, while Rangers are gaining popularity amongst the gay skin 
        set. Docs come in every colour and pattern you can think of, but skinheads 
        tend to stick with oxblood or black. GET STEELCAPS! Not only do they look 
        best, but you never know when you may need 'em! KEEP THEM POLISHED! Alternate 
        between black and cherry for oxblood. Lace colours can be a big statement, 
        different colours have different meanings around the globe. White was 
        universally known as WHITE POWER<br>
        (losing it's meaning?), they look smart, but if your gonna wear 'em, make 
        sure you can back yourself up! (this is where steelcaps come in handy). 
        Choose a colour that you feel comfortable with.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRACES</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1/4 inch 
        are the most popular but hardest to come by, especially in Britain. Red, 
        white and black are the colours to wear. Also come in check patterns. 
        If your gonna wear them around your bum, PLEASE make sure they don't drag 
        along the floor!</font><br>
